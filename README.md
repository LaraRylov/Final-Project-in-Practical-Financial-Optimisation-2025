# Final-Project-in-Practical-Financial-Optimisation-2025

All coding designed for the final project in the summer course Practical Financial University 2025 at University of Copenhagen can be found here.
Multiple models, including the Markowitz model, a Downside Regret model and the CVaR model, has been implemented into either Python or GAMS. Bootstrapping has been implemented in GAMS to create scenarios for use in the Downside Regret model and the CVaR model. 
Futhermore, a backtesting procedure has been implemented in GAMS to asses the investegation af optimal asset allocation. 

Mutiple different graphs and performance metrics has been computed in Python to help display all the interesting findings. The implementation of these can also be found here.

Everything has been completed by the two math.econ students Sara F. Svenstrup and Lara N. Rylov.
